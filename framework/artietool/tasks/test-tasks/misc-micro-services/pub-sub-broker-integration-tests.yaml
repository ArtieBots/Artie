# - Attempt to publish messages to multiple topics and verify that they are received by the appropriate subscribers based on the topics they are subscribed to
# - Attempt to publish messages with encryption enabled and verify that they are received and can be decrypted by subscribers with the correct cert/key files, and that subscribers without the correct cert/key files cannot decrypt the messages
# - Verify latency of various sizes of messages
# - Verify throughput of various sizes of messages and various numbers of subscribers and publishers
