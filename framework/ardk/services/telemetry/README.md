# Telemetry Service Design Document

TODO: This document will describe the design and architecture of the Telemetry Service.
        This includes software design, data flow and retention, and integration with other services.
TODO: Tie design decisions to the requirements document.


This document describes how telemetry data (including logs and metrics) is formatted, collected, stored, retrieved, and deleted.

TODO: We need to ensure that hardware metrics are collected and reported.
      Spurious resets of Yocto images should be collected here and
      presented to the user in Workbench.
