# Artie CAN Library

This document describes the Artie CAN library, which provides an interface for communication over the
Controller Area Network (CAN) bus used in Artie robots.

It also describes the mechanical and electrical design of the CAN bus system.

The protocol that we use for communication over CAN is described in the [Artie CAN Protocol
Specification](../../../../docs/specifications/CANProtocol.md).

TODO: Write the design document for the CAN library and bus system, similar to the one for ArtieTool.
