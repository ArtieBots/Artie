# Firmware

This directory contains firmware for the various MCUs.

* [Eyebrow MCUs](./eyebrows/README.md)
* [Mouth MCU](./mouth/README.md)
* [Reset MCU](./reset/README.md)

TODO: Use this document as the SDD for the firmware.
      In particular, include how the firmware interacts with CAN, how FW updates are handled, error states, and logging.
      If there are important mechanical or electrical considerations that affect the firmware design, include those as well.
