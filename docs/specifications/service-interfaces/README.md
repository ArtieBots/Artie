# Service Interface Specifications Folder

This folder contains all the specifications for the various service interfaces.
A service interface is composed of three things: a name, an IPC type, and an API.

## Service Interfaces

Service interfaces have a name, which is the topic in pub/sub IPC, or the service
name in RPC.

Service interfaces have an IPC type: either pub/sub or RPC.

Service interfaces have an API that they expose.

Each of these three things is documented in each interace document in this directory.
